        <p class="lead text-center">About Me</p>
        <br />
        <p> I am 18 years old and a first year at City University. Despite coding for the first time 
      during quarantine, I enjoy it immensely and feel fulfilled whenever a program I work 
      hard on is successful. Other than coding, I also enjoy playing many sports, such as football, 
      basketball, swimming, cycling, and many different martial arts. Gaming is also one of my 
      hobbies, which was the first thing that piqued my interest in coding. I would wonder why the 
      sprites in the game moved the way they did, and now that I know, I find it much more fun to
      create my own games than play other people's. I've also built multiple computers before, a 
      skill that I taught myself from YouTube videos and Wikihow guides.

        <p class="lead text-center">PROJECT Loosen Up (Coding Bootcamp 2020)</p>
        <br />
        <p> I called my first program 'PROJECT Loosen Up'. Concluding the 2 week Programming 
        Bootcamp at City (2020), I have made extensive use of loops, shapes, rotations,
        translations, accelerative movement, changing colours, and much more. I created 
        an optical illusion using small ellipses accelerating back and forth in a straight
        line from one end of another (larger) ellipse to the other. The acceleration of 
        the small ellipses is coded using parameters with float variables representing
        velocity. I have also declared and initialised variables representing the speed
        at which the little balls move, as well as the time difference in which they
        travel relative to one another. I've created a help page that can be toggled 
        using 'H' on your keyboard, and there are instructions on there on how you can
        interact with the illusion using arrow keys. Project Loosen Up radiates a very
        relaxing vibe, so I imported ambient music to play in the background while you 
        interact with it to further highlight the theme of 'loosening up'. If you'd like to
	play with it too, you can access the code <a href="https://github.com/aymen-a99/adbs948">here.</a> Enjoy!

        <p class="lead text-center">PROJECT OMARALPHA</p>
        <br />
        <p> My second program is a game that I called OMARALPHA. You play as a soldier in the war against COVID-19, and your job is to save the world from it. You control your soldier using the WASD buttons on your keyboard, and the soldier will aim his virus shooter towards your cursor. There are four levels. To advance, you must destroy a specific number of viruses. Each level has a different number of viruses that fly at increasing velocities towards you (depending on how far you've gotten in the game), and you take damage for each virus that hits you. Naturally, there are health packs that spawn at random intervals in each level to make your life easier. The harder the level, the more health packs spawn because trust me, you'll need them. On the final level, you will encounter the great boss OMARALPHA, a large monster with high health stats that chases you. To defeat him, you must shoot him 50 times while evading his attacks. There is a HUD that allows you to see your score, lives, and the lives of the OMARALPHA boss, as well as a GUI so that you can pause your game for some dinner, quit if you have to go somewhere, and a save / load function if you want to come back later. I hope you enjoy!
